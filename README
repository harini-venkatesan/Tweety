We streamed tweets and collected 1GB worth of tweets with location of the tweet, text, hashtags, time created and username as parameters. We then ran ElasticSearch on the collected tweets to create an index. 

Our interface primarily runs on a web browser that takes query terms from the user and the location of the user and returns the top 100 tweets with the query. We then display the tweets on a world map using a heat map. The user can either search for tweets with the query and their location as a parameter, or search for the tweets worldwide and we display where it was tweeted from

Running Web Inteface files:

Note: this code runs on python 3.7.1
			Django 2.1.7
			Elasticsearch-dsl 6.3.1
      To install Django and elasticsearch-dsl run
	>pip install Django
	>pip install elasticsearch-dsl

1) Move to CS172_Project directory
	>cd CS172_Project
		Note: there are 2 directories with the same name, one
	      	is a subdirectory. You must be in the first CS172_Project
	      	directory such that you can see the following files:
	      	manage.py, db.sqlite3, main/, _pycache_/,CS172_Project
2) Run the server
	>python manage.py runserver
3) To stop the server run
	>CTRL+Break

Elasticsearch notes:
	first prepare json file by executing json_to_es.py then 
	to bulk load data, on command line  
	   -move to directory where output file from json_to_es.py (tweets.json) is
	   -curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_bulk" -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data-binary @tweets.json
	   -open browser at http://localhost:9200/_cat/indices
	   -should display "yellow open tweets yKYje4hBRs6-moP87ZTUDA 5 1 104 0 111.6kb 111.6kb"
